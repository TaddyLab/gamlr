Description: This package provides log penalized linear model estimation.
	It calculates regularization paths via coordinate descent.  The log penalty, s*log(r+|b|), spans the range of non-convex cost functions between L0 and L1 norms.  As much as possible, usage is analogous to that for the glmnet package (which does the same thing for penalization between L1 and L2 norms).
